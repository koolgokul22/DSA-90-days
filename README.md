Space and Time Complexity ( Day 1-2 )
  
    1.Analysis of  Algorithms
    
   
    2.Asymptotic Analysis
    
      - Measures the order of growth.   
      
      - Consider only those terms that have highest order growth and ignore the remaining terms. 
      
      
    3.Order of Growth
    
      - How fast the program execution time f(n) increases wrt to the input size 'n' , where f(n) is program execution time.   
      
      - c < log log(n) < log(n) < n^(1/3) < n^(1/2) < n < n log(n) < n^2 < n^3 < 2^n < e^n < n^n
      
      
     4.Best, Average, Worst Case
      
      - We always consider the worst case scenario.
      
      
     5.Asymptotic Notations
     
      - Represents the order of growth in mathematical form.
      
      - Big O => Exact or upper bound
      
      - Theta => Exact bound
      
      - Omega => Exact or lower bound
      
      - We are interested in exact or upper bound notation.
      
      
     6.Analysis of Recursion
